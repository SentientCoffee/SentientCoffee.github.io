# Description

A project that aims at co-designing prototypes to improve the traditional form of reminiscence therapy for persons with dementia (PWD) by adding immersive, customizable and interactive virtual reality (VR) experiences. Reminiscence therapy is a multi-sensory treatment that uses a combination of sight, touch, taste, smell and sound to help PWD to remember events, people and places from the past, which can facilitate better understanding and management of responsive behaviours.

# Responsibilites

- Development and testing of facial tracking and emotion recognition software for useon patients in dementia care units
- Gained experience with the Unity engine, the OpenCV computer vision library and the Tensorflow Keras machine learning library
- Made a user experience evaluation app that does not store any personal patient information for use in tandem with a VR reminiscence therapy treatment
